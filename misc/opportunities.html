<h1>Opportunities</h1>


<p>Elderly care robots can help young people relieve the pressure of caring for the elderly. 
   For example, robots can monitor the health of the elderly at any time, detect health problems in time, and then treat them in a timely manner.<p>
<p>For people with disabilities, help them do things that are inconvenient for them. There is no gender difference in nursing robots.
   On some privacy issues, whether it is the elderly or disabled, there is basically no rejection of the help of robots.</P>
<p>When the robot is working, there will be no emotional problems, so the possibility of causing work mistakes will be greatly reduced.</p>
