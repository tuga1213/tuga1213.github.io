<h1>Robot Companions and Caregivers</h1>





<p>As the global ageing problem worsens, the declining birth rate reduces the proportion of young people who can provide care, so that societies now often lack adequate care for older persons. </p>
<p>At the same time, the pressure of young people's lives is increasing, work occupies most of young people's time, and there is not enough energy to take care of the elderly. </p>
<p>At the same time, it also seriously ignores the well-being of the disabled, the inconvenience and high cost of travel, and the discrimination of others make the life of the disabled more and more difficult.</p>
