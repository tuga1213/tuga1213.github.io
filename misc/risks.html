<p>Robot companions are also at risk, especially for the elderly and disabled who cannot take care of themselves, and does all-round monitoring and detection violating their privacy? </p>
<p>Machine failure is also a problem to consider, due to power outages or system errors may cause harm to the elderly and disabled.</p>
